WeCAAD(We connect artists and directors) is an online web platform which is made to be used by artists and directors. It is basically an online stage for directors to cast artists for their future projects.

Online medias are ranging on high fire due to the current pandemic and several online streaming platforms are continuously making several new shows. There are talents everywhere, so our plan is to match the talented artists with directors.

Director uploads a script and sets the characterâ€™s basic attributes. Next the system chooses the artists matching with these attributes from their portfolio and sends them the respective scripts. Artists are to act and upload it to the system ,then director chooses and ranks them
